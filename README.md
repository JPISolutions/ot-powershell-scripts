# Introduction

When setting up OT server systems for use with OT software platforms it is often required to make specific modifications to the Windows Server operating system. This setup takes a good chunk of time on each system that needs to be configured. 

This project aims to provide a set of PowerShell scripts that will make the necessary modifications to Windows to make OT systems work properly. This may include adjusting power settings, tweaking Windows Firewall, and making other quality of life improvements as per typical vendor recommendations. 

The project is arranged into several folders with various PowerShell snippets and some larger combined script files. 

Target Operating Systems:
- Windows Server 2012R2 to 2022
- Windows 10/11
